# RISK-V GoL - created by Sim√£o Ribeiro
# This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in RISK-V assembly language.
# I'm using the RV32I instruction set and the RARS simulator.
# I still wanna decide some things, like the size of the grid, the initial state, etc. 
# About the features, I want a simple game, just printing the grid in the console and updating it every generation.
# Regarding the initial state, I'm thinking about a random state, or a user input state.
